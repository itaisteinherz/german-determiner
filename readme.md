## Development

To run the app locally, set the `YANDEX_API_KEY` environment variable to be your [Yandex Translate API](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/) key (which you can get from [here](https://translate.yandex.com/developers/keys)). Then, simply run `$ npm start` to run both the web app and the Netlify Functions server (or `$ npm build` to build everything).
